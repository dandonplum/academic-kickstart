Daniel Plamondon is an undergraduate history student at the University of Michigan - Flint. His current research revolves around African-American combat units in World War 1. Other areas of study include American colonialism and the emergence of the United States as a world power. 

Outside of the classroom or library, he'll be found arguing theology with his friends, enjoying the nature of Michigan with his girlfriend, or tossing a Frisbee with his brothers.
