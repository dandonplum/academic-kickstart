<p>*I initially wrote this piece two weeks after the standoff between Nick Sandmann and Nathan Phillips, in an attempt to understand the various issues at play for myself, with an emphasis on the role that fast-paced media played in shaping the narrative. 
Here it is in all of it's lightly edited glory*</p>

<p>Over the last few days, the controversy surrounding the standoff between a Native American veteran and a group of students from a Kentucky catholic school has gone “viral”. In this age of instant media attention and smartphone video, the focus and sympathies often lie with the first person to publish their side of the story. Because people naturally believe what they see with their eyes, the evidence presented by video often seems undeniably true and non-contradictory.</p>  

<p>As a historian, I’m trained to understand that everything has a perspective and a bias. That goes from letters to eyewitness accounts to oral histories to the historian’s own analysis. A major discussion that we have in class is whether the presence of video will change how historians interpret this time in the future. I think that this example surrounding the catholic boys and the native American man is a good example of how video won’t change standard practice, merely augment.</p>  

<p>After the initial releasing of the first video, the public outcry over social media, and the extensive reporting of the incident through professional media sources, a number of longer videos purporting to show “more context” began emerging, presumably in an effort to demonstrate that the catholic boys weren’t the savage racist brutes they were being portrayed as throughout the internet and news networks. These contextual perspectives were mostly mocked on social media by users who had already made up their mind on what had transpired, after all, they had seen the evidence, and it was damning.</p>  

<p>Videos like the initial one, however, will always serve as confirmation of bias already had. For many people, an incident like this is exactly what’s needed to demonstrate the belief that the election of a populist, bullying, uncouth president is corrupting the nation and the youth in particular. Southern white males surrounding and confronting a man from a minority group persecuted since the beginning of this nation paints the perfect picture of what’s wrong with America and those currently in power. Could the “MAGA” hats send a clearer message? On the other side of the belief spectrum, those same hats inspire an instant rallying to these boys and an instant attempt to produce evidence that bolsters their position, because surely this can’t be whole story.</p> 

<p>And the right wing folks are right, that initial clip isn’t the whole story. But their videos aren’t the whole story either. The whole story happened on that weekend, and everyone involved has a different story, a different outlook, a biased perspective based on their beliefs, affiliations, positions, and maybe even whether their hearing aids were tuned correctly or if they left their glasses at home. The perspective our brains construct is built around sensory detail, sure, but narrative structure and memory serves an important role too.</p>  

<p>That’s why from a historian’s perspective, I’m gratified to see that the professional news networks are finally conducting interviews with participants and attempting to bring in extra information into the picture. They’ve interviewed the Native American man, they’ve discussed the incident with at least one of the boys, and are beginning to investigate in more detail various perspectives. Sadly, most people already made up their minds who was at fault days ago. Social media and instant video sharing often force the hand of professional organizations to not report the incident, but the reaction to the incident. Scoops belong to the common man now, not to the press. If the press were to report on the incident in an unbiased manner, it wouldn’t quite be news anymore, and so I can’t fault them for going with the popular opinion. However, it warms my heart to see this story further dissected and pulled apart, because when I go to review this in a month or so, I’ll get much more information and the ability to paint a clearer picture if I choose to write on this.</p>  

<p>See, I haven’t watched any of the videos yet. I saw the initial outrage, wanted to join in, watch the video, like a few angry posts on Twitter, and move on with my views on the state of the nation more firmly intrenched. It’s easy. It’s cathartic. As a white guy, it feels important to make sure that I don’t identify with people who appear to be exposing hateful viewpoints or acting in a hateful manner.  Image cultivation on social media is important. As an academic however, I’d be doing myself and those around around me a disservice by simply bandwagoning onto the existing narrative. Even when the conservative folks joined in with their context videos, I held off again, because the aim of those was to simply defend their people from the hate storm and to fuel the hate between the two opposing cultural and political sides of our country. Two perspectives are good, but having participants recount their experience afterwards was even better. Obviously everyone has their own bias and will strive to put themselves in the best light possible during an interview, but that’s all part of obtaining many looks at the issue. No one has the definitive shot on this sort of thing, no matter what someone may show you or how much “context” is given. In essence, no matter the truth, the damage has already been done. No matter who started the confrontation in D.C., the fault is on you and me for letting ourselves become divided and partisan in our attitudes towards people who are different than us in all sorts of ways, not just in physical attributes, but in moral, intellectual, and political ideologies as well. We start our discussions not on respect, but on superiority of ethics or politics. If I had a dollar for every time I’ve heard someone refer to Democrats as godless trash, or hearing someone being called a racist/bigot for questioning leftist policy on immigration or prison reform, I could buy the presidency. Wait, someone beat me to it.</p>
